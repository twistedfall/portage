General: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Canon with respect to the Software and supersedes any prior oral or written representations, agreements or understandings with respect to the Software. Neither party shall have any remedy in respect of an y statement made to it upon which it relied in entering into this Agreement (unless such statement was made fraudulently) and that party's only remedy shall be for breach of contract as provided for in this Agreement.

If at any time any part of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or partly illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction that fact shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.

The failure or delay of Canon in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall not in any circumstance operate as a waiver of such right, power or remedy.

No variation to this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an authorised representative of Canon.

Third Party Beneficiary: The provisions of this Agreement, in so far as it relates to Canon's third party suppliers, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, are directly enforceable by such Canon's third party suppliers, subsidiaries and/or affiliates.

Law: This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with Dutch Law. All disputes between the parties which may arise from this Agreement will be resolved exclusively by the District Court of Amsterdam the Netherlands. Canon shall have, however, the sole right to waive this Section and to enforce this Agreement under the local law and/or jurisdiction of the user.

OTHER LICENSE TERMS: WHEN YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT ANOTHER END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE SPECIFIC SOFTWARE YOU ARE INSTALLING.
